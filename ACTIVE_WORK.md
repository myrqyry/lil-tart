# Active Work

Subject: `fix/consumer-runtime-integration` — downstream consumer hardening and
the retrieval scoring entrypoint.

## Outcome

A downstream application can consume Lil Tart inference packages by Git SHA
through their public entrypoints, without hitting app-origin or stricter-TypeScript
breakage, and the retrieval scoring surface is a deliberate, documented choice
rather than an accidental export.

## Why it matters

This branch defines the supported downstream surface other apps are expected to
depend on. Anything published here becomes a contract: once a consumer can reach
it, removing or reshaping it is a breaking change under the project's single-revision
policy.

## Current state

**Branch context** (committed, and already pushed to
`origin/fix/consumer-runtime-integration`; not yet in `master`):

- `32e666a` *fix: harden shared consumer runtime paths* — resolve LFM pipeline
  model assets from Hugging Face instead of the app origin; remove unused
  retrieval state that broke stricter downstream TypeScript consumers.
  Touches `apps/playground/src/components/LfmPipelinePanel.tsx`,
  `packages/retrieval/src/colbert.ts`.
- `8c9cb8b` *feat: expose retrieval scoring subpath* — add
  `"./scoring": "./src/scoring.ts"` to `packages/retrieval/package.json` so
  consumers can import pure scoring without loading the ColBERT package entrypoint.

**Current working tree (dirty, uncommitted):** the branch commits above were
complete, but three defects and one missing contract surfaced in review. All are
now closed in the working tree.

Subpath coverage (from the first review round):

- `tests/fixtures/external-consumer/src/index.ts` — imports `maxSim` and
  `rankDense` from `@litert-playground/retrieval/scoring`, so the packed tarball
  must resolve the subpath for `pnpm test:compatibility` to pass.
- `tests/package-boundaries.test.ts` — new test
  *"keeps the retrieval scoring subpath a verified public entrypoint"*: pins the
  `exports` map, reads the subpath target so a rename breaks the suite, and
  asserts `scoring.ts` never imports `./colbert` or `@huggingface/transformers`
  (that independence is the subpath's entire reason to exist).
- `docs/package-revision-policy.md` — states that subpath entrypoints are
  supported on the same terms as `.`, and lists `@litert-playground/retrieval/scoring`.

The base-swap follow-ups:

- `packages/text-gen/src/litertlm-pipeline.ts` — the real bug. `load()` passed the
  manifest's repo-relative path straight to `Engine.create`, bypassing
  `context.assets` entirely, so all four `kind: 'text'` models in the LFM panel
  still resolved against the app origin and 404'd. The branch's stated purpose was
  only half-delivered. Now routed through the resolver (`stream`, else `Blob`).
  Upstream `@litert-lm/core@0.15.0` `engine_settings.d.ts:38` confirms
  `model: string | Blob | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`, so this is verified, not
  assumed. Side benefit: text models now participate in Cache Storage.
- `apps/playground/src/modelStorage.ts` — `listStoredModels(base)` now counts only
  entries recorded against that base, and `pruneSupersededModelCaches` reclaims
  entries orphaned by a base change. Cache keys embed the resolved absolute URL,
  so every pre-move entry was unreachable while still being counted.
- `apps/playground/src/modelStorage.test.ts` — new; covers base filtering, the
  prefix-collision case, and reclaiming.
- `apps/playground/src/components/LfmPipelinePanel.tsx` — `MODEL_BASE` constant so
  the resolver and the storage reporting cannot drift; comment recording that
  omitting `assetBase` moves the LiteRT WASM host to the pinned jsDelivr CDN
  (`apps/playground/public/` has no `wasm/` dir, so origin-relative was dead).
- `CHANGELOG.md` — entries for all six changes across both branch commits, which
  previously had none.
- `.meristem/` + bounded `.gitignore`/`AGENTS.md` blocks from substrate init.

Nothing is staged. No stashes.

**Base:** `master` is at `c3bd5a5` (merge of `aster/downstream-inference-surface`).
The branch is two commits ahead of it.

## Locked decisions

- The new retrieval entrypoint is a **subpath export** (`./scoring`), not a new
  package and not a deep `src` import. The revision policy explicitly forbids
  consumers importing from a package's `src` directory.
- Model assets for the LFM pipeline resolve from Hugging Face, not the app
  origin, so the app and package consumers agree on where weights come from.
- Repository is `myrqyry/lil-tart`; package namespace stays
  `@litert-playground/*`. Do not "fix" the mismatch.

## Constraints / do-not-regress

- `pnpm verify` is the pre-merge gate. Do not bypass the pre-push hook.
- Boundary tests enforce that `inference-core` stays independent, examples consume
  public entrypoints, and the playground depends on `runtime-litert`. A new
  entrypoint must not weaken these.
- Anything claimed as supported downstream surface must be packable and
  consumable by `pnpm test:compatibility`, with no `workspace:*` leakage in packed
  metadata.
- Keep the supported packed surface and `CHANGELOG.md` consistent with what
  packages actually export. The project keeps a live `[Unreleased]` section;
  shipped public API changes belong there.
- Stage by explicit path, never `git add .`.

## Current objective

Land the branch. The downstream contract for the `./scoring` entrypoint is now
decided, tested, and documented, so the remaining work is delivery:

1. Review the working-tree changes above and commit them by explicit path
   (never `git add .`).
2. Mention the `./scoring` export in the PR description so consumers know it
   exists — the one part of the review feedback not satisfiable from the repo.
3. Get the branch into `master` once CI is green.

## Verification

Established against the current tree, not inherited from earlier commits:

- `pnpm verify` — exit code 0. All six stages green: typecheck, per-package
  tests (retrieval 7/7, qwen3-tts 13 files, playground 12 files, …),
  boundaries 13/13, compatibility 10/10 packages, qualification 19 files, build.
- `@litert-playground/retrieval` compatibility row: `pass pass pass pass`
  (import, peers, typecheck, build) with the subpath import live.
- **Mutation check.** Three deliberate regressions were introduced and reverted;
  each was caught rather than passing silently:
  1. Renaming the export key to `./scoring-typo` — boundary test failed on the
     `exports` match, and the compatibility harness failed with
     `TS2307: Cannot find module '@litert-playground/retrieval/scoring'`.
  2. Restoring the old `const model = modelPath` in text-gen — both new text-gen
     tests failed.
  3. Deleting the `belongsToBase` guard in `listStoredModels` — all four new
     storage tests failed.
  Each mutation was reverted and the suite re-confirmed green.

Not established: browser runtime evidence. Nothing here was exercised in a real
browser session, so no runtime or manual UI claim is being made. In particular the
text-gen fix is verified at the type/API boundary and by unit tests, not by an
actual generation run in a browser.

## Open uncertainty

- Whether `./scoring` duplicates logic still reachable from `.` is now
  answerable but unchecked: `src/index.ts` re-exports all five scoring
  functions, so the subpath and `.` currently overlap completely. That is
  harmless, but the subpath's independence is only meaningful if the two are
  expected to diverge. Worth a deliberate decision at some point; not blocking.
- `pruneSupersededModelCaches` deletes cache entries for a model whose recorded
  base differs from the one in use. That is provably unreachable data, but it is
  still a deletion policy chosen without the project owner. If two panels ever
  share a `modelId` under different bases, one panel's copy would be reclaimed.
  Not currently the case; worth confirming it stays that way.
- The tokenizer path in encoder/colbert calls `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(repoId)`,
  which resolves against the Hugging Face hub directly and therefore ignores a
  custom model base. Pre-existing, not introduced here, and out of scope.
- Whether `packages/retrieval` peer/version metadata needs any change for a
  second published entrypoint (currently `0.1.x` peer on `inference-core`).
  Judgment says no, since `./scoring` imports only types from `inference-core`.
- `docs/superpowers/` is git-ignored and holds local plans/specs; it may contain
  intent for this work that is deliberately not shared. Not inspected.
- `AGENTS.md` and `docs/package-revision-policy.md` still duplicate conventions,
  workflow rules, and the nested-agent-file list. Now that the subpath rule had
  to be written into the policy doc, the duplication cost something concrete.
  Collapsing them into one authority is a real decision still unmade.
